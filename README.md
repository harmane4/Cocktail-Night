## Description

Cocktail Night generates random cocktail recipes at the click of a button. It was created to save time whilst searching for cocktail recipes and help those with little cocktail knowledge or are just simply bad at decisions.

The application is perfect for those wanting to participate in the highly popular Instagram and Tik Tok trend [#cocktailnight](https://www.tiktok.com/tag/cocktailnight?lang=en).

Users must have an account to use Cocktail Night. They can then generate a random cocktail recipe and save that cocktail to their account. Once a cocktail has been saved it can them be viewed and referred back to.

The bartenders choice button will generate a new random cocktail (or mocktail as Cocktail Night promotes responsible drinking of alcohol).

The application is deployed on Heroku and be be viewed [here](https://ancient-badlands-55523.herokuapp.com/)

## Future Development

In the second release of Cocktail Night users will be able to search cocktails via alcohol which will be suitable for users with greater cocktail knowledge.

As drinking cocktails is a social activity, slice two will incorporate this as users will be able to choose cocktails for their friends.

Lastly, in an effort to increase user experience for those not versed in the imperial system, units of measures will be converted to mls
